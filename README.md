## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Effective Prompts

-   Be specific about what you want
-   Include context about your campaign setting
-   Mention the tone or style you prefer
-   Ask for specific details (names, motivations, hooks)

### Examples of Good Prompts

```
"Create a dwarven blacksmith named Thorin who secretly forges weapons for a rebel group opposing the tyrannical king. Include his workshop description and a reason players might seek him out."

"Describe the Whispering Woods, a haunted forest where the trees themselves seem to speak. Include local legends and a specific mystery for players to investigate."

"Generate a corrupt noble family that controls the city's trade routes. Include family members, their scheme, and how players might get involved."
```

### World Consistency

The assistant considers your world's:

-   Existing actors and their names/types
-   Scene names and locations
-   Journal entries and lore
-   Game system being used

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Please configure your API key" message**

-   Ensure you've entered a valid OpenAI API key in settings
-   API keys start with `sk-` and are about 51 characters long

**"Connection failed" error**

-   Check your internet connection
-   Verify your API key is correct and active
-   Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account

**Responses are too short/long**

-   Adjust the "Max Tokens" setting (higher = longer responses)
-   Modify your prompts to be more or less specific

**Responses don't fit your world**

-   Add more specific context to your prompts
-   Create journal entries with your world's lore for the AI to reference

### Performance Tips

-   Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for faster, cheaper responses
-   Adjust temperature lower (0.3-0.5) for more focused responses
-   Clear conversation history periodically to improve context

## Privacy and Security

-   API keys are stored locally in your Foundry world
-   Conversation history is stored locally, not sent to external servers
-   Only your prompts and responses are sent to OpenAI's API
-   No personal data is collected by this module
